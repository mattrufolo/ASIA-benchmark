# NanoDrone 3-Fold Benchmark

Benchmark and training code for ASIA on the Crazyflie 2.1 nano-drone system.

This benchmark follows the nano-drone system identification benchmark introduced by Riccardo Busetto, Elia Cereda, Marco Forgione, Gabriele Maroni, Dario Piga, and Daniele Palossi in *Nonlinear system identification for a nano-drone benchmark* (Control Engineering Practice, 2026).

## Project Overview

The project trains a neural sequence model to predict the full 12-dimensional drone state (position, velocity, attitude, angular rates) from motor speed sequences.

- Training data: three trajectory types (chirp, random, square) — each type contains multiple CSV runs
- Test data: one held-out trajectory type (melon)
- Fold structure: leave-one-trajectory-out over the 3 training types (3 folds)
- Prediction horizon: fixed 50-sample windows (~0.5 s)
- Initial conditions: drone state at the step preceding each window
- Cross-validation selection metric: aggregated MAE across the 3 validation folds
- Test metric: grouped MAE over the four 3D output triples: position, linear velocity, attitude, and angular velocity

## Useful Branches for Reprodubility

The repository includes two additional branches that are useful for reproducing or inspecting the ASIA workflow:

- `best`: best-performing model branch
- `final`: final branch after ASIA completed the experimentation cycle

To switch to the best branch and reproduce the learning of the best model:

```bash
git switch best
uv sync
uv run train.py
```

To switch to the final branch and inspect the final outputs produced by the AI agent after the end of the experiments:

```bash
git switch final
```

To return to the main branch:

```bash
git switch main
```
